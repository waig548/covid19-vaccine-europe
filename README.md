# covid19-vaccine-europe-attempt-01-failed
A weird program for query data of covid19 vaccines administered in europe and perhaps some analysis.

A failed attempt of this project, or rather an inefficient one. As it turned out, loading every data to memory first then trying to do operations is fairly inefficient, and may have security vulnerabilities. (Though the data is not really important per say...)
