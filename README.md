# covid19-vaccine-europe
A weird program for query data of covid19 vaccines administered in europe and perhaps some analysis.

So eh, this is a thing now... Eh, whatever. This thing is still kinda WIP because kinda still need some time figuring out how to make things happen, aaaannnd, I'm running out of time.
So I might come back to this at some point.

# Branches

`master` - current developement

`attempt-01-failed` - failed attempt

# covid19-vaccine-europe-master

An attempt of using pointers to locate every entry (row) of data, turns out to be far quicker than `attempt-01-failed`, both data preprocessing and operation performance have seen significant improvements.

Currently WIP, with some archival and referencing purposes.
