# covid19-vaccine-europe
A weird program for query data of covid19 vaccines administered in europe and perhaps some analysis.

So eh, this is a thing now... Eh, whatever. This thing is still kinda WIP because kinda still need some time figuring out how to make things happen, aaaannnd, I'm running out of time.
So I might come back to this at some point.
